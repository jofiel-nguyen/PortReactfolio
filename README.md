# React Apps Portfolio

Welcome to my React Apps Portfolio! This repository showcases various React applications I've developed. Below, you'll find instructions on how to run, test, and build the applications, as well as some additional information about the project.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhunguyen-debug/REACT-APPS.git
```

Once you have the repository on your machine, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd REACT-APPS
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following npm scripts:

### `npm start`

This script runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Use this for running tests and monitoring changes. Refer to the testing section for more information on testing.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for performance. The build output will include minified files with unique hashes for filenames. Your app is now ready for deployment!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you are unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices provided by Create React App, you can eject. Ejecting will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except eject will still work but will point to the copied scripts. You can customize your project as needed after ejecting.

You don't have to use eject unless you have specific customization requirements. Create React App is designed to work well for most projects.
